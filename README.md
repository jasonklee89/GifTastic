# GifTastic

### About / How to Use
GifTastic is an application that loads any GIF of your choosing on to the page.  The page will at first load a static image of the GIF.  Once you click on it, the GIF will start to animate.

### Functionality
* GifTastic utilizes the GIPHY API to load GIFS
* We first populate some examples at the top of the page, and render them with an array of search examples
* The user can add their own custom search--once they submit, they will create their own button at the top of the page
* Once the button is clicked, an ajax call is performed which then populates the page with the search

### Running Locally
